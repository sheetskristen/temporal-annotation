    <TEXT>[Today's Market Forecast]Mortal CoilThe good news about last year's flat stock market? Stocks got cheaper. The bad news? They could get cheaper still.In 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had one of the most uninspiring annual performances of its 109-year history, finishing the year down 0.6% -- which is to say almost perfectly flat. The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings. In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Money-market mutual funds have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity this year. Their assets may never return to the record levels reached in the fall of 1982, shortly before banks were allowed to offer competing "money market accounts." But the floundering stock market, the rise in interest rates and a rate advantage over the bank competitors have led consumers to increase their holdings of these easy-access, market-rate investments.Investors shouldn't assume that the more than 300 money funds are all alike. The funds can differ in such things as their minimums for investment and check-writing and the ease of getting through to customer-service people on the telephone. Perhaps more important, they also vary widely in the types of short-term assets they buy. These differences produce varying yields and levels of risk."Money funds are looked at as a homogeneous, commodity-type product. But when you look at them closely, you see there are really big differences in risk and management policy," says Edward A. Taber III, money-fund portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.Consumers haven't had to become aware of the risk differences because the money funds have an excellent safety record. No fund has ever owned a security that defaulted. Investors suffered a 6% decline in principal in one small fund several years ago, but that was because the fund had extended the maturity of its holdings to the point that many would say it wasn't even a money fund anymore. Nevertheless, there conceivably could be principal losses in a money fund, so investors should be aware of how much risk their particular fund is taking.The most common type of money fund is one that invests in a diversified portfolio of short-term government securities, bank certificates of deposit and corporate obligations called "commercial paper." Other funds stick to the safety of government obligations. There also are big distinctions within each category. Yields generally rise with the risk of the investments, as shown in the accompanying data from Donoghue's Money Fund Report.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board stressed the importance of fighting a weak economy, indicating support for policies aimed at reducing the high unemployment rate."Over the next few years, the Fed must craft policies that ensure that our economy accelerates its progress along the recovery path it has begun to trace," Janet Yellen, the nominee for Fed vice chairman who has served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004, told the Senate Banking Committee. "With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy."Ms. Yellen appeared at a confirmation hearing Thursday alongside two other nominees to become Fed governors: Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Peter Diamond and Maryland financial regulator Sarah Bloom Raskin.If confirmed to the seven-member Fed board, the trio would likely push the balance of power at the Fed toward those who worry more that the economy isn't expanding quickly enough rather than those worried about the risk of unwelcome inflation.Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) noted that recent data suggested that the economy was moving toward price deflation. "It is evident that the economy is going to need all the help the Fed can provide over the coming year," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GREENSPAN SUGGESTED that progress against inflation may be drawing to a close, but stopped short of saying policy makers will have to raise interest rates. The Fed chairman said 1996 so far "has been a good year" for the economy, but that it would begin to slow down in the second half. He said the Fed will be in a state of "heightened surveillance" for signs of higher inflation in weeks ahead.Stocks and bonds rallied on his testimony. The benchmark bond's price rose nearly 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield back below 7%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 87.30 to 5464.18, and the Nasdaq gained 23.17 to 1109.82.---AT&T showed significantly lower calling volume and revenue growth in the second quarter, though its overall net income rose by 10%.

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- Japanese stocks pulled back yesterday, as uncertainty over the downfall of corporate financier Yoshiaki Murakami and declines in U.S. stocks from Friday prompted profit-taking in pricey blue-chip shares such as Toyota Motor, Canon and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial.But many of the stocks in Mr. Murakami's fund rose, after falling sharply on Friday on fears the fund might sell off its shares.The Nikkei Stock Average dropped 121 points, or 0.8%, to 15668.31 following a 285.57-point rally on Friday.Most investors said the effect likely would be limited on the overall Tokyo stock market from the Murakami scandal. But some also said they want to see foreign investors' reactions to the news. Mr. Murakami, who leads the so-called Murakami Fund, admitted yesterday that he had violated the country's insider-trading laws, and would step away from his own fund and investments.Yesterday, the home for many of the Murakami stocks of start-up companies, the TSE Mothers market, saw its index rise 3.4% to 1393.86, but it is still down about 50% from its year high of 2799.06 in January.

    <TEXT>DETROIT -- Even as the auto industry and environmental groups gird for another political fight over fuel economy, private discussions are under way to work out a truce.The Big Three auto makers, the United Auto Workers union and environmental activists are negotiating to try to come up with a joint proposal for what they have come to conclude is the most realistic way to improve the fuel economy of the U.S. automotive fleet: a big package of federal subsidies designed to seed a consumer market for vehicles that go farther on a gallon of gas.Though the longtime antagonists are far from a deal, the fact that they are negotiating at all marks a big shift, suggesting each of them has decided the political impasse in Washington over fuel economy is contrary to its interests. For the auto industry, an intensifying political battle over the fuel consumption of sport-utility vehicles has become a public-relations nightmare. For the union, the specter of a shift toward newer, more-efficient vehicles raises worries about job losses for its members.For environmentalists, the realization is setting in that a severe toughening of the federal government's fuel-economy rule is a political nonstarter. Therefore, some of them are concluding, the only way to get substantial improvement in the fuel economy of the U.S. fleet is to spur market demand for more-efficient vehicles. That is a tough task in a country where gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, remain at historically low levels. But it is precisely the tactic the auto industry has been endorsing all along."Many of us want to solve the problem and get to a solution," said Ashok Gupta, director of the air and energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups involved in the discussions. "So you have to think out of the box and try to break the gridlock."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Care to guess what has been the highest-flying of the larger technology stocks in the past year?It isn't Intel, Microsoft or even Iomega. Of stocks with more than $1 billion in market value, the biggest percentage gainer is Dell Computer, a company that does nothing more complicated than assemble computers and mail them to customers.In the past 12 months, Dell's stock price has more than quadrupled. Intel is up 146%, Microsoft has doubled, and data-storage darling Iomega, after a dramatic rise and fall, is up 55%. As many tech stocks have sagged in the past few weeks, Dell has proved surprisingly robust, losing just 7.4% off its Feb. 26 high. It closed Friday at 70 1/8, down 2 1/8.What explains Dell's startling stock-market success? Two things -- one good and another more worrisome.The good news is that Dell has been firing on all cylinders amid strong double-digit unit growth for world-wide personal computer sales. Dell's once-controversial formula -- skipping middlemen by selling direct, and building machines only once they are ordered -- has become the envy of the industry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>JAPANESE FIRMS' PRODUCTIVITYJapanese corporations' productivity lags behind their U.S. counterparts in terms of purchasing-power parity, the Japan Productivity Center said in its latest survey. This parity compares the amount of goods that can be bought for a certain amount of money.Average productivity in all Japanese industries, or gross domestic product per employee, was less than that in the U.S., France, the former West Germany, and Britain. The U.S. surpassed Japan in productivity by 31%. The figures are for 1988, the latest available.In forestry and fisheries, the U.S. was more than three times as productive as Japan. Japan almost equaled France in manufacturing but was outpaced by the U.S. and Britain.Japan had the advantage only in the electric power, natural gas and water supply industries.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- After mild fluctuations, major currencies ended little changed.With European financial markets closed for the Easter holiday and little data to trade on, analysts say investors initially sold technology stocks and the dollar on news that Microsoft Corp. might be forced to split off its various divisions.The dollar rebounded during the New York session, despite a mixed performance in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq Composite Index fell about 160 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 62 points."It takes more than Nasdaq moves lately to have a sustained impact on the dollar," said Bob Lynch, currency strategist in New York with French bank Paribas. "The impact [the Microsoft report] had might have been more sizable than normal, too, because there was nothing else to focus on."Late Monday, the dollar was at 105.79 yen, nearly unchanged from 105.84 yen late Friday. The euro was at 93.75 cents, little changed from 93.81 cents late Friday in New York. Against the yen, the euro slid to 99.22 yen from 99.36 yen late Friday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Earlier this month an ad appeared in this newspaper entitled "Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare." It was signed by 61 top Silicon Valley executives, including me. In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to "bring home the pork" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as "government investments" or "government-industry partnerships." Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories:</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever: Have the financial markets detached themselves from the "real" economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product?For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes. And they find it misguided to see the gyrations of the 1998 U.S. stock market as a reliable indicator of either a continued boom or an imminent bust.The stock decline is "not telling us a thing about the U.S. economy," said James F. Smith Jr., professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. "There's hardly anything wrong with the U.S. economy today that you can't solve with lower interest rates."It's tempting to believe otherwise, of course. It was less than eight weeks ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record 9337.97. Optimists saw it as proof of a new economic paradigm. Bolder types concluded, as they had in past years, that the business cycle had been repealed by tremendous strides in technology and productivity, justifying enormous leaps in stock prices.Today, just a few weeks later, doomsayers point to the plunging financial markets and the global damage inflicted by the Asian crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So-called managed-payout funds, introduced with much fanfare just two years ago, were supposed to be a boon for retirees. Some of the hype might have been premature, however.It has long been one of the biggest questions and challenges for people entering retirement: How do I generate a steady paycheck from my savings? Managed-payout mutual funds offer an answer.Designed by some of the biggest names in the financial-services business -- Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab, among others -- these investments use different strategies but start with the same concept: Place a pool of money in a range of investments, much like an endowment at a university. Ideally, the funds generate a predictable, but not guaranteed, stream of income in a format that gives investors easy access to their money.That kind of predictability already was available from insurer-run annuities. But many retirees are loathe to turn over their money to annuities, from which it can be difficult to withdraw funds. What's more, insurers generally keep any remaining money when you die.Bear-Market Debut</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy. That means more volatility lies ahead. Investors should watch out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- When Ben Bernanke was nominated to head the Federal Reserve in 2005, he promised to "maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years." But in handling his first financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke shows signs of a break with Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman from 1987 to 2006.That shift is important in understanding why Mr. Bernanke hasn't cut the Fed's main interest rate yet, and it could alter investors' expectations of how the Bernanke Fed will function.The Fed historically has had two major economic duties. Maintaining financial stability is one. Controlling inflation while preventing recession is the other.To Mr. Greenspan, market confidence and the economy's growth prospects were so intertwined as to make the Fed's two duties almost inseparable. He cut rates after the 1987 stock-market crash and the near-collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 to prevent investor reluctance to take risks from undermining the nation's economic growth.By contrast, Mr. Bernanke distinguishes between the central bank's two functions. So, on Aug. 17, the Fed cut the interest rate and lengthened the term on loans to banks from its little-used discount window in hopes banks would use the window -- or at least the knowledge it was available -- to lend to solid borrowers having trouble getting credit amidst the market turmoil. The action was aimed at restoring the normal functioning of disrupted credit markets, not primarily at boosting growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Rev. Al Sharpton once epitomized New York's bad old days of the 1980s, when the then-corpulent, gold-medallion-bedecked tub thumper inflamed racial hatred and courted violence. Today, against all expectations and at least 100 pounds lighter, he has been rehabilitated into the Democratic Party's civil-rights leader of choice. Has Mr. Sharpton changed or simply outlasted his critics?President Obama's embrace of Mr. Sharpton has been particularly intense this year. On Monday he called Mr. Sharpton's radio show to discuss the Nov. 4 elections. In April the president appeared at a political rally organized by Mr. Sharpton's National Action Network. Mr. Obama's closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett, conferred with Mr. Sharpton in August about the police killing of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., as Mr. Sharpton led protests against the Ferguson police.The Democratic establishment is just as obsequious. It turned out in force earlier this month to celebrate Mr. Sharpton's 60th birthday party at New York's tony Four Seasons restaurant. Hillary Clinton phoned in with best wishes. Barack and Michelle Obama sent a congratulatory letter. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gushed: "He's the nation's Rev. Sharpton -- and the nation is better for it." New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Reps. Charles Rangel and Jerry Nadler rushed to pay their respects.Worrying as it might be for America to see Mr. Sharpton catapulted into the national limelight, that is nothing compared with the alarm felt by many New Yorkers now witnessing his emergence as a political power in their city.When New Yorkers elected Bill de Blasio as mayor last year, they knew they were getting a self-styled "progressive" who pledged to soak the rich and shackle the New York Police Department. What they didn't know was that they were also voting to bring Al Sharpton and his influence into the very heart of City Hall. The mayor's alliance with the racial provocateur is now creating the biggest crisis of his mayoralty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The economy continued to grow in December, but at a slower pace, a monthly survey by purchasing agents indicated.The National Association of Purchasing Management said its members reported a decline in new orders, production and employment in December. For the 13th consecutive month, prices continued to fall."Traditionally the industrial economy slows in December, so what we are seeing isn't unusual," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee and purchasing director at Pitney Bowes Inc. "However, the fourth quarter and the year were a pleasant surprise. The continued low level of price increases also indicates inflation isn't on the horizon."The report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 industrial companies, indicates whether various indicators of the economy are better, the same, or worse than the previous month.The survey's composite index, on a seasonally adjusted basis, declined to 51.1% in December from 53.3% in November, the first drop in three months. But it was the fourth consecutive measure above 50%, a sign that the economy is expanding. A reading below 50% indicates the economy is in a declining phase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes fell 8.1% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000, the lowest pace in a year. Analysts predicted they could drop further in coming months.The August decline followed a revised 2.2% decrease in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, the Commerce Department reported. The department originally had said sales of new single-family homes were unchanged in July.The decrease is "in line with expectations for what I think is a moderate decline in construction and new and existing home sales," said Mark Riedy, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "I think we're near the bottom of the decline."While Mr. Riedy and several other economists expect new-home sales to drop modestly through year-end, they disagree about next year's outlook because of uncertainty about the mortgage interest-rate picture. New-home sales should total about 665,000 for all 1984, up from 623,000 last year, Mr. Riedy forecast, saying that next year they "may be a little higher" or the same.Future new home-sales activity depends on interest rates, and "I don't see much promise of them falling enough" to spark a resurgence of demand, said James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Similarly, Michael Carliner, a senior economist at Chase Econometrics, sees new-home sales dropping to a rate of 590,000 next year from his projected 625,000-unit rate this year, saying there will be "a small surge" in mortgage rates in 1985.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The outlook for the global economy has darkened considerably, with the spreading financial crisis expected to push several advanced economies into recession, the International Monetary Fund said."The world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s," the IMF said Wednesday in its World Economic Outlook.Just a few months after upgrading its global forecasts, the IMF is now ratcheting down its expectations for the economy this year and into 2009.The world economy is now expected to expand at a 3.9% pace in 2008, down from the estimate of 4.1% in July. The 2009 forecast was slashed from 3.9% to 3%, which would be the weakest level since 2002 and near the threshold of what the IMF considers a global recession.While the IMF still expects a recovery to begin late next year, it warned there are "considerable downside risks" to that scenario, which assumes U.S. and European governments will succeed in their efforts to stabilize markets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short-selling activity soared at the New York Stock Exchange in the first half of March.For the twice-monthly reporting period ended March 14, the number of short-selling positions not yet closed out at the Big Board -- so- called short interest -- jumped 7.04% to 16,009,687,994 shares, from 14,956,961,052 shares in late February.Marketwide, the short ratio, or number of days' average volume represented by short positions outstanding at the exchange, fell to 3.5 from four at the end of last period, as volume soared. The figures are based on trading in NYSE-listed names across all exchanges.Investors who "short" shares borrow and sell them, betting the price will fall and they will be able to buy the shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. In general, the higher the short interest, the more investors expect a downturn. Downdrafts tend to boost the value of short positions and embolden bearish investors.Recent volatility in the stock market, in particular among bank and financial shares, has benefited short sellers who placed well-timed bets on the right companies, said Harry Strunk, a principal at Treflie Capital Management in New York. Mr. Strunk surveys a group of short- only managers on a monthly basis; the value of the average short- selling portfolio gained 12.5% in the first two months of 2008, compared with 18.4% for the first three months of 2001, according to Treflie data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's latest two nominees to the Federal Reserve Board said they expect the economic recovery to continue and see little risk of deflation, suggesting they think the Fed may have no need to cut interest rates again.Ben S. Bernanke and Donald Kohn, who would fill two remaining vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board of governors, told the Senate Banking Committee the economic outlook remains bright despite growing worries about the U.S. financial system."I think we're in a situation where vigilant optimism is probably the right approach," said Mr. Bernanke, a Princeton University economics professor who sits on a national committee that determines when recessions begin and end. "The economy is recovering, but there's no sign of inflation," he said.Asked if continuing weakness could lead to Fed rate cuts, he said that -- despite already-low rates -- "if necessary, we could do so."Mr. Bernanke, 48 years old, also said the recent decline of U.S. stock prices has done "large and serious harm" to national wealth that could hurt economic growth for the rest of the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The dollar looks poised to weaken somewhat this week, as the market turns its attention to the last big batch of data ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of the month.However, political events elsewhere could help the dollar, as Japan readies for its June 25 Lower House election and Europe grapples with economic reform. Analysts expect the dollar to trade in a range of 103 yen and 108 yen and near 96 cents against the euro.Many European markets are closed today for a holiday.Analysts expect more data indicating that the U.S. economy is slowing, which would feed speculation that the Fed will pass on raising interest rates at its June 27-28 meeting. "The key data are retail sales and consumer prices," said John Rothfield, senior currency strategist at Bank of America in San Francisco. "We expect those to be benign, and that will probably trigger a rally in some of the other currencies."The producer-price index for May, announced Friday, was unchanged, suggesting that consumer prices also will be benign and leaving an uncertain outlook for U.S. interest rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Automobile makers raised prices and reduced dealer incentives on 2004 car models in October while California, the nation's biggest auto market, increased car taxes -- moves that prompted consumers to cut back on purchases.That was the upshot of a slew of government data released Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that producer prices rose a larger-than-expected 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October from the month before, largely because of higher auto prices. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau reported retail sales slipped 0.3% in October, largely due to declining auto sales."Manufacturers are adjusting incentives in part to see how well their products can do without incentives as the economy strengthens," said Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J.D. Power & Associates, a market research company. "Consumers, being finicky as they are, just don't like to see incentives go down, and they're pulling back."The Federal Reserve also reported that industrial production rose for the fourth straight month in October, but the pace of increases was curtailed by a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies.Some auto makers responded by fattening incentives in November. This is leading some economists to predict the October sales slowdown and the spike in prices will be temporary. "It is the pregnant pause of a wiser consumer," said David Littman, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Detroit. Underscoring expectations of a pickup in consumer spending later in the year, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose to 93.5 in early November, stronger than the late October reading of 89.6.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks don't do nearly as well when the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, so what are small-cap portfolio managers doing to prepare? Not a heck of a lot.The annual gain of the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks falls to roughly 3.5% when the Fed is raising rates, compared with its historical average advance of 12%, according to James Furey, chief small-cap analyst at Lehman Brothers.The reasons for the falloff include smaller stocks being closely tied to the performance of the U.S. economy, which can be slowed by interest-rate increases. Also, smaller businesses face the prospect of having to pay more for loans, which could curb their expansion.When the Fed has raised rates in the past, defensive areas like energy and certain health-care stocks fared better, while economically sensitive shares, such as retailers, home builders and manufacturers lagged behind. But don't assume that portfolio managers are positioning themselves to follow the past performance.</TEXT>

But Homer's couldn't survive the current crunch, which has wiped out hundreds of furniture stores across the country.Based in Chicago, Homer's was known for custom-crafted furnishings, once using extra-high cushions to make a sofa more accessible for a paraplegic couple. But by making its own furniture, the family-owned chain had high fixed costs. Then the recession cut customer traffic. Discount wars ate up margins. Specialty stores siphoned sales. In 1991, Homer's lost money for the second consecutive year, and the company's creditor shut Homer's five stores on New Year's Eve."When it happens, it's like a loved one lying in bed dying, and one day he closes his eyes," says Chairman Marvin Homer, whose immigrant father founded the company in 1912 with four brothers. "I felt numb."The home-furnishing business has taken a beating this recession as consumers have decided they can do without new $1,200 wicker sofas and $700 paisley poufs.

    <TEXT>Would you pay $15,000 for a car? Most of us would consider the question odd: It depends on which car. In the current tax cut debate, 10-year revenue costs of $350 billion and $550 billion are being debated, but the question should be: for what? President Bush's tax cut was designed to provide short-term growth insurance and enhance long-term growth. Does it deliver?If you listen to the political rhetoric, the most controversial of the president's tax proposals is the elimination of the double tax on corporate income. This would not be the case if scientific analysis were introduced into the debate. So far, neither the administration nor the Joint Committee on Taxation has provided an element-by-element evaluation of the different proposals. Name-calling tends to break out when there is no substance to discuss.When the Council of Economic Advisers considered the economic benefits of the president's entire proposal, the agency emphasized demand-side effects on consumer spending and investment in the near term. Using a conventional forecasting model, effects of the tax plan on job prospects, household disposable income, and incentives to invest were projected to raise real GDP by about $670 billion over the next five years. This increase in output would raise revenues by $133 billion over that period.But even that analysis omits the long-run supply-side benefits. The dividend tax reduction has the strongest economic merits. Ending the double tax raises long-term income by increasing capital formation and improving the use of existing capital.The first thing to track is the direct effect on investment. The dividend tax cut significantly reduces the cost of financing new investments. If businesses invest more, economic growth increases. The connection between the cost of finance and business investment is one of the least contentious areas of economic science, and cautious applications of the results from studies of tax policy and investment suggest that eliminating dividend taxation should add about a quarter of a percentage point to real GDP every year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- With the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates behind it, the options market looked forward to its next signpost: tomorrow's monthly expiration of options contracts.The problem is, traders and strategists frequently complain that expiration isn't as big an event in the options market as it once was. They say that this is partly because the position-rolling activity isn't as concentrated in the last few days leading up to expiration as it used to be.Cibc World Markets options strategist Michael Schwartz said that a midafternoon scan of yesterday's most-active options contracts yielded few suspects for trades that were rolling positions forward, those that occur when an options player moves a position's expiration farther out, sometimes also using the opportunity to move the strike price up or down.One possibility, though, was Cisco Systems Inc. With the stock falling 2 9/16 to finish at 58, Cisco's May 60 and June 70 calls were among the most active call contracts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that the activity may have been the result of expiration-related adjustments.Additionally, options trading hasn't been as active as some would like. Paul Foster, options strategist at 1010WallStreet.com, complained that this week's expiration is "the driest expiration I've seen" in the past 12 months.</TEXT>

Here's how to jump on board.The campaign, called Go Direct, is an effort by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to make it easier and safer for recipients of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income to get their monthly payments -- and in doing so, save the government millions of dollars in postage, printing and related costs.Currently, the Treasury Department mails about 160 million benefit checks a year, which translates into $100 million in printing and mailing expenses. In about 2 1/2 years, the first of 77 million baby boomers will become eligible for Social Security benefits, which could cause the number of mailings and related costs to soar.In March, federal officials completed a six-month pilot campaign, also called Go Direct, in three states and Puerto Rico to determine how best to motivate people to switch to electronic transfers of money to their bank accounts.The key: enlisting the help of local organizations and businesses -- including more than 13,000 volunteers at banks, senior centers and health and consumer groups -- to spread the word.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's good news and bad news for the Reagan administration in the poverty statistics for 1984, published Tuesday by the Census Bureau.The good news is that after increasing steadily during the administration's first three years until the number of poor reached a post-1965 high, poverty has begun to decline. The economic recovery of 1983-84 brought greater prosperity to many of the poor as well as to most everyone else. As a result, about 1.8 million people moved above the poverty line. Moreover, the improvement was broad-based, with the black poor in particular showing significant gains. At least for the time being, this accomplishment should quiet those who have criticized "Reaganomics" as unfair to the less well-off.The bad news is that even after a period of robust economic growth, the Reagan administration so far still has wound up with more people in poverty than at any time since 1966 (except, of course, for its own time in office). The nearly one-percentage-point reduction last year -- from 15.3% to 14.4% of the population -- is nothing to sneeze at. However, it's not unprecedented and is just about the same amount by which the poverty rolls had been rising annually. More improvement may yet come, but it will be increasingly difficult.The reason is that many of the remaining poor fall into groups that have typically had above-average rates of poverty. In 1984, 35% lived in female-headed households; 10% were elderly; 20% fell into the category of "unrelated individuals," which includes widows living alone, lodgers and others without close ties to the rest of society.These people are not unaffected by economic conditions. To the contrary, economic growth means increased earnings for those who work or higher welfare benefits for those, like the elderly, who do not. During 1984, the Census Bureau reported better incomes for each group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Senate Republican leadership drafted a revised budget plan that would eliminate any cost-of-living increase for Social Security beneficiaries next year and hold growth in fiscal 1986 defense spending to the rate of inflation.President Reagan endorsed the lower military figures in an effort to win passage of the total package. Most of the increased savings from the Pentagon would be used to restore proposed cuts in domestic programs.Though relatively small in 1986, the deeper savings from the president's proposed defense budget would amount to $17.7 billion over the next three years when compared with an earlier leadership compromise allowing 3% growth after inflation. Only last week, Mr. Reagan criticized the Senate for being "irresponsible" when it rejected the higher military figures. In accepting the revised budget package, the administration has agreed to more than $21 billion in reductions from its initial spending request for fiscal 1986, which starts Oct. 1, and more than $115 billion in the next three years.The GOP leadership, scrambling to win needed votes, backed away from terminating such sensitive items as Amtrak subsidies, the Job Corps, the Small Business Administration, mass transit operating assistance and "impact" education aid for public school districts affected by federal installations. More than $5 billion was restored to student aid and federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and proposed agriculture savings were reduced in an effort to appease farm-state senators.Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D., Neb.) was expected to vote with the Republicans after winning what he estimated were $2.5 billion in restorations for farm programs, and a White House aide predicted narrow victory for the budget package.

Some analysts have questioned the post-recapitalization earnings outlook, calling it overly optimistic.Moreover, because of the big borrowings, FMC would have a negative net worth of about $627.7 million at the end of this year under the plan. And the company projects that its net worth wouldn't be positive again until 1991. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the plan May 22.In its proxy material, FMC said it received commitments from a group of banks led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York to raise about $1.4 billion for the plan.

The drop, the third in a row, followed declines of 0.2% in February and 2.0% in January, and left orders 15.4% below a year earlier."Today's orders are tomorrow's production," said Stuart Hoffman, economist with PNC Financial Corp., a Pittsburgh bank holding company. "So I think this signals that production and jobs {in manufacturing} will be down in the second quarter."The majority of economists believe the economy will turn around and grow slightly in the second period, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a survey of business economists and consulting groups. And some sectors of the economy, such as housing, have shown signs of bottoming out. But the durable-goods report was strong evidence for those who believe that the recovery may be a few months further down the road and that growth won't restart until the third quarter."This puts to rest the notion that with the end of the war came the end of the recession," said Nancy Sidhu, an economist with Security Pacific National Bank. Ms. Sidhu pointed in particular to a 10.3% slide in orders for nondefense capital goods, closely watched as a barometer of the industrial sector's investment and production plans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Target-date funds, which suffered a black eye in the market crash, are looking better these days.During the bear market of 2007-09, target-date funds designed for investors retiring in 2010 lost about 37% on average, according to Morningstar Inc., blindsiding some soon-to-be-retirees. These funds were taken to task by government officials, lawmakers and investors for what some said were overly aggressive allocations to stocks and for failing to clearly explain their strategies and risks."Some investors didn't realize they could lose money," says Robyn Credico, a senior consultant at employee-benefit consulting firm Towers Watson.The stock market's rebound from its early-2009 low has propelled most of these funds back into positive territory, even for some investors who bought at the market's 2007 high, prompting some in the industry to say concerns about the funds' asset allocations were overdone.Despite the improved performance and the fact that some fund providers have taken steps to reduce volatility in their portfolios, some industry watchers say target-date products may still be too risky for those in or near retirement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You asked for a soft landing. You got it.If investors are finding the economic environment bewildering these days, they shouldn't complain. Confusion is the consequence of the long-hoped-for soft landing, that catch-all phrase that connotes moderating economic growth, declining inflation and lower interest rates. After all, a soft landing is neither fish nor fowl. It isn't a powerful economy that drives corporate earnings (and eventually inflation) sharply higher, but neither is it a sickening plunge into recession."We're all groping for the trend in the economy, and the data are contradictory," says Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu in New York. "If it weren't and the statistics were all bad, we'd be talking about a recession. If the statistics were uniformly good, we'd be talking about an accelerating economy and no need for the Federal Reserve to ease" credit.But all this leaves investors confused and worried. Because the economic picture is so puzzling, they don't know whether to buy or sell stocks, and which stocks they should own. That's particularly important now because this is the stage at which the economy is delicately balanced and could move quickly either into a recession or acceleration.And that's the trouble with the "soft landing" analogy. While an airplane taxis to the gate and shuts off its engines after landing, the economy just keeps rolling right along.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The chief opponents of the Bush administration's plan to bail out the savings and loan industry presented Congress with a list of objections to the proposal yesterday but became the target of criticism for the role they played in creating the crisis.Officials from the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest lobby group for S&Ls and the chief critic of President Bush's plan, were criticized by members of the Senate Banking Committee who said the league contributed to the problem."If anyone has been irresponsible on this issue, it's the U.S. League," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). Gramm said that the league's actions were rivaled only by members of Congress who have sympathized with the lobby group's positions.Shelby, Gramm and other senators asked league chairman Barney Beeksma why the league told the Senate two years ago that $5 billion was all that was needed to resolve the S&L problem, which is now expected to cost at least $157 billion over the next 10 years.But Gramm persisted and quoted from a letter the league wrote on March 6, 1987, to the General Accounting Office, supporting the appropriation of $5 billion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's no exaggeration to say that the 1980s were dominated by economics. The politics and psychology of these 10 years have swirled around the central issue of how nations enhance their wealth. Ronald Reagan's economic policies undergirded his popularity. Communism's economic failure triggered political upheavals in the Soviet Bloc and China. Japan's emergence as a great power primarily reflects its stunning economic success.Greedy is the glib label stuck onto the '80s. How silly. Greed had never disappeared; it merely became more conspicuous. The decade's significance lies elsewhere. We rediscovered some old truths about economics. Competition works. It generates economic growth by fostering efficiency and innovation. In the '80s, U.S. living standards and productivity rose. But competition can be rough, and the decade seems baffling precisely because its gains often emerged from disruptive changes.We endured fierce foreign competition and the worst recession since World War II. Corporate America was no longer invincible. It faced hostile takeovers as well as rising imports. Companies were forced to become more efficient and to hold down costs and prices. But their responses-layoffs, plant shutdowns and streamlining-were often hurtful and unsettling.It's been that kind of confusing decade. Looking back, I'd cite 10 major economic trends that will affect the '90s.1) The Triumph of Free Markets: Faith in competition replaced the view that government spending and low interest rates spur economic growth. The result has been stingier government, higher "real" (after-inflation) interest rates and more emphasis on free markets. The change is global. From Mexico to France, state-owned companies have been sold ("privatized"). Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and China are trying market policies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told legislative leaders today that Virginia is coming out of the recession slower than the rest of the nation, and as evidence said that tax collections for the current budget year are projected to be $151 million less than expected just six months ago.The governor said one member of his Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates called it a "stealth recovery - so slow it would be difficult to see."Because of a previous agreement with the legislature, Wilder told the legislature's three money committees that he would use most of his $200 million rainy-day fund to make up for the shortfall, rather than further cutting programs and jobs.The one bit of good news that Wilder offered today was that he would support an additional $15 million for local school aid.Wilder said his economic advisers predict that the state "will continue to under-perform the national economy in housing construction, consumer spending and employment growth" during the next 11 months. The state has lost about 49,000 jobs in the last year, more than half in Northern Virginia, Wilder said.</TEXT>

Kerry for president because they are concerned about the economy and the size of the federal budget deficit.In a conference call with reporters in southern states, Warner said the historical pattern of business leaders backing Republican candidates will be broken this year, nationally and in Virginia."You've got more business support this year for the Kerry ticket than even [Bill] Clinton did in 1992," he said. "There's a real unease among many of the business leaders in the state."On Monday, the Kerry campaign released a list of 200 business executives nationwide who have signaled their support for the Democratic nominee. The list contained three names from Virginia: Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice president of technology strategy for MCI; Roger W. Sant, co-founder and chairman emeritus of AES Corp.; and Warren M.

    <TEXT>It appears no fewer than four times on the top 10 list of best- selling funds for early 2005: Capital Income Builder, Capital World Growth & Income, Income Fund of America and the Franklin Income Fund. By comparison, "growth" shows up only three times and "global" just once.Those four income funds together took in 20 cents of every dollar that went into all stock and bond funds in January and February, by my calculation using figures from the consulting firm Financial Research Corp. in Boston.The investing public and their advisers, it appears, have embraced income funds as the great anti-speculation, a remedy for the excesses of the last great bull market. As an extra kicker, U.S. rules now give most dividends the same lower income tax rates accorded long-term capital gains.The idea seems sound enough. The question is, could success spoil this pretty picture? Is everybody on guard against the danger of increased risk that tends to infiltrate any category of investments enjoying a hot streak? "We have great respect for dividend-paying ability as an indicator of quality," says Tom McManus, chief investment strategist in New York at Banc of America Securities LLC. "But today's investor seems to be chasing high current income without regard for growth or safety."When you look at the recent performance of some of these funds, their popularity is no mystery. According to Bloomberg data, the $32.3 billion Franklin Income Fund averaged an 11.3 percent annual return over five years through the end of March, a period in which the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a loss of 3.2 percent a year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congress will appropriate more than $1 trillion this year, and all the Congressional Black Caucus wants is $1.3 billion. But after six months of haggling over the funding for a youth jobs program, the group is running out of time.The 42-member CBC has pushed for months for Congress to extend funding for a youth summer jobs initiative that was created in last year's economic stimulus bill. Similar to a program in the District, the initiative gives localities money to hire young people ages 14 to 24 for clerical work, construction and other entry-level jobs that last six to eight weeks.The funding is not specifically allocated based on race, but localities are encouraged to offer jobs to youths who are "most in need," such as high school dropouts and children whose parents are incarcerated -- groups that are disproportionately African American. The CBC hopes the funding will provide for about 300,000 jobs.The failure to secure the money illustrates a broader challenge for the CBC. In the midst of the recession, black lawmakers and civil rights advocates have called for specific policies to aid African Americans and other low-income people. Their argument is twofold: At 16 percent, the unemployment rate among blacks is higher than for other groups, and the increase in federal spending to ease the recession could help address persistent unemployment and other long-standing problems for blacks and low-income people.Rather than focus their efforts on President Obama, who has expressed reluctance to target funds for blacks or any other group, the CBC has tried to push measures through Congress. But as deficit concerns rise in both parties, the black lawmakers have had little success.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read with much interest the article about the Supreme Court raising its fee limit for court-appointed attorneys in capital cases to $5,000 {Jan. 25.} While I share some of the anger and indignation of Vivian Berger, the Columbia Law professor who "won" the increase, I also believe her anger is somewhat misdirected.As a law student at Georgetown University who plans to serve indigent clients when I graduate, I know all too well the dearth of legal resources for have-nots. In addition to the fact that the pay is incredibly low (in many cases probably lower than the $17 per hour Vivian Berger received in her case), the funding is so limited that many lawyers who would like to practice in the Public Defender Service or legal services agencies must be turned away.But with all this inequity, I'm not really sure the government is the best place to seek change. Certainly Vivian Berger was correct in stating that the Supreme Court sends a powerful message in setting attorney fees. But those cases are paid for by the government of a country that is in a recession and that has proved quite well that it cannot manage its finances. Meanwhile, she is surrounded in New York (as we are here in Washington) by hundreds if not thousands of lawyers who are charging $395 per hour. I have yet to meet a human being whose abilities are worth $395 an hour. Isn't there a better way to spend that kind of money?In theory, lawyers are to adhere to standards of professional responsibility. I quote from the ABA's Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 2-25: "Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in serving the disadvantaged. The rendition of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough to meet the need."Now, I suspect that most of the lawyers in this country who are charging fees of $200 and up per hour have limited expertise in criminal law. But that need not foreclose their aid to indigent clients. Through their firms, they could establish legal defense funds: they could hire one or more associates per year who would specialize in criminal defense and thereby carry the bulk of the firm's legal aid obligation. They could target current associates and partners with an interest in criminal law, free them for additional training if needed and credit their billable time for their efforts on behalf of indigents - without limit. And criminal law need not be the only area in which law firms do more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue of trade policy -- as critical to the nation's future as Iraq and every bit as divisive -- is now squarely before the Democratic Congress. It will almost certainly provide a huge challenge to its leadership.The stage was set by a painfully negotiated deal between the White House and Democrats, announced last week, on the terms of trade in pending agreements with Peru and Panama. Those agreements with two small nations are just the overture for a much larger debate involving tariff-cutting deals with Colombia and South Korea. And then comes the monumental question of whether to give President Bush the same free hand that his predecessors have enjoyed in negotiating global and regional trade agreements, not amendable by Congress but subject only to an up-or-down vote.Before last week, there was no chance that a Democratic Congress would trust Bush to look out for the interests of American firms and workers in any such negotiations. Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.Such provisions -- requiring signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards banning child labor and prison labor and permitting union organizing, as well as requiring enforcement of their own environmental laws -- had been included in the final trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress.</TEXT>

These include the peso crisis in Mexico and an expected rise in German interest rates. Whatever the causes, the sagging dollar is beginning to ring alarm bells among top U.S. officials.The dollar's weakness promoted an unusual expression of concern this week from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Fed, Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee, will be watching the dollar's value closely in coming months.President Clinton, at a press conference yesterday in Ottawa with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, observed, "Well, the truth is that all of us have . . . something less than 100 percent control over the value of our currency. . . . I was stunned last year when the value of the American dollar went down when we were having 4 percent growth, the best economic year in 10 years, {and} the lowest combined inflation-unemployment rate in almost 30 years."In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4618 marks, down from 1.4675 late Thursday, the Associated Press reported. The dollar improved slightly against the yen and was changing hands at 97.00 yen, up from 96.71. The dollar's record low against the Japanese currency was 96.12, reached Nov. 2.</TEXT>

And he told Volcker the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins law requires the Fed to report to Congress on the rate at which it wants the basic money supply to grow.Proxmire questioned the legality of the Fed's refusal to provide an M1 target but said that he would try to use quiet diplomacy to get the central bank to change its position.M1 consists of money involved in transactions-currency, checking accounts and travelers checks-and according to some economists is linked to economic growth: If money supply expands, growth increases; if it shrinks, the economy contracts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve, concerned that the economy's sluggish growth could signal a possible recession, yesterday cut short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point -- its first move to lower rates in nearly three years.The dramatic turn in interest rate policy was announced by the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee. It said it would cut the federal funds rate, the interest rate financial institutions charge on overnight loans to each other, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent.Several banks immediately said they would follow the Fed's lead and reduce their 9 percent prime lending rate to 8.75 percent, effective today. The reduction will benefit many small-business borrowers and consumers with home equity loans and credit card balances, whose rates typically are tied to the prime.The Fed's announcement had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street, following weeks of speculation about how the Fed would react to signs that the economy was weakening. Both stock and bond markets surged after the 2:15 p.m. announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks gaining 48.77 points to close at a record high of 4664.00.The Fed's move to cut rates yesterday ended a cycle of tightening that began in February 1994. Over the next 12 months, the Fed raised short-term rates seven times, lifting the federal funds rates from 3 percent to 6 percent, in what Fed officials said was an effort to slow economic growth before it triggered a surge of inflation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For many, taking a sick day requires little thought. But by most estimates, nearly half of all private-sector workers in the United States do not have a single day of paid sick leave. And more do not have a paid day off that can be used to care for a sick child.Low-wage workers are hit the hardest, with three of every four lacking any paid sick leave. They also usually have no health-care coverage or work a full-time or more than full-time schedule of piecemeal, part-time jobs, making paid sick leave even more unlikely.When workers without sick leave get a virus or an injury, they have to decide if they can take an unpaid day off and still make the rent. If not, they often return to their jobs as security guards, cooks, waitresses and cashiers -- decreasing their productivity and possibly getting others sick. Paid sick days can reduce turnover, cut down on health-care costs (although most companies that don't provide paid sick leave also don't provide health-care coverage), and increase productivity and morale.There was movement on the paid-sick-day front last month. More than 60 percent of voters in San Francisco approved a ballot measure that would require all businesses with fewer than 10 workers to give employees up to 40 hours of paid sick leave a year; for larger employers, up to 72 hours. At every company, an employee will accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, so both part- time and full-time workers would be covered.It probably won't end with San Francisco. There is a push to get similar measures in front of decision makers in other cities and states in the coming year, including in the District.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am sick of everyone blaming the breakdown in the credit and housing markets on subprime loans. Subprime loans were certainly part of the problem, but they are a symptom of a deeper issue. What's happening in the market today is not the bursting of a five-year bubble but the bursting of a 40-year bubble and the failure of the mortgage loan system to meet the needs of the marketplace.The truth is that subprime lenders, by responding to demand, were the finger in the dike for the whole housing market. The real problem is affordability and the incongruity between incomes and home pricing.Forty years ago, the median national price of a house was about twice the median household income. In some parts of the country, this ratio was closer to 1 to 1. Twenty years ago, the median home price was about three times income. In the past 10 years, it jumped to four times income.But in most major economic centers, typical families haven't been able to buy a home for anything near the national median price for decades. Try to find a single-family home in the D.C. area for the national median of $221,900. In the major markets, there is tremendous dependency on alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which in turn has created a dependency on the least scrupulous mortgage companies and lenders.The issue of affordability is not news to the major players in real estate. Each month, lenders, developers and government agencies study the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index. This index provides a way to track whether housing is becoming more or less affordable for typical households nationwide; it incorporates changes in key variables such as home prices, interest rates and incomes.</TEXT>

One question frequently asked is: Mas there been any unexpected or basic change in how economy operates in past 7 years?۝ I don۪t think so. In 1955, I wrote a book on analyzing economy and forecasting. I think model contained in that would cover almost all liiat iias happened. There would be some important changes in emphasis and details, but off-hand 1 can think of no major change in concepts, theories or even approach.(a)	There has been no major financial crisis. No major financial institutions	failedalthough	speculation probably was as great as in past periods when they did. Expansion of national output was longer and greater than in any prior expansion. Depth of recession smallerand it was planned. The basic knowledge means we can avoid major depressions. In 1966 and 1970, there were questions as towhether Fed could avoid a crunch۝ by performing as lender of last resort. T assumed Fed would be sensible and it was. Note though this limits tightness of monetary policy compared to what some would advocate. (b)	On the other hand, better knowledge and communication probably means increased basic instability in private sector and particularly in financial markets. Expectations (or speculation) spread faster. People react more rapidly and strongly in the spheres of prices, wages, investments. This raises major problems for policy change.(c)	We want to operate within that zone of the trade-off curve of output and priceswhere required policy moves go beyond bounds of our information or knowledge. We cannot fine tune to extent wc would like because we are operating within random variance of data and knowledge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At the Buster Brown children's clothing factory in Coeburn, Va., manager Joe Gillespie speaks the sort of language unheard for years in the coal fields counties of Southwest Virginia: "We've hired 60 people in the last two months and we plan on hiring another 60 in the next few months."Almost unnoticed, the economy of the chronically depressed counties along the Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia borders has begun to stir for the first time since a worldwide boom in coal peaked in 1982.Shopping centers are under construction in St. Paul and Norton. Outside Lebanon, Mattaco Inc. has put 65 people to work making parts for automobile cruise-control mechanisms destined for new Fords, a figure that will rise to 150 as soon as the company can get additional production machinery up and running.Meanwhile, since the region's rugged landscape makes it hard to find enough flat land for a house, much less a factory site, a remote mountaintop is being leveled in Buchanan County to accommodate a new $32 million state prison that eventually will provide about 350 new jobs and an annual payroll of $7 million.The new prison, which was ordered put in Buchanan County by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles precisely to give the area an economic boost, is the largest, but not the only, evidence of a determination in Richmond to try to help the coal fields counties begin to catch up with the economic success of the rest of the state.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interest rates are on the rise again, and that's bad news all around. Major commercial banks raised the prime rate for the fourth time this year to 10.5 percent, highest in almost four years. And we may not be at the end of the cycle.Higher bank interest rates have been expected in the wake of what banks claim have been their own rising costs of money. But there could be an element of greed, too, as banks try to make up for losses on Third World loans.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board is keeping an eagle eye on the recent slide of the dollar. A depreciated dollar helps exports, but it has two negative aspects: it threatens new inflation stemming from the higher cost of imported goods, and it also can discourage the flow of foreign investment necessary to finance the national budget deficit. The Fed is walking a tightrope between the desirability of low interest rates to spur domestic expansion and higher interest rates to prop up the dollar.Unless he gets help on the deficit-control side from fiscal policy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan plainly warned in recent testimony, he may have no choice but to opt for higher interest rates.That could choke off an already tiring, six-year domestic expansion and confront the Bush administration with sudden recession. Higher interest rates would also compound massive problems in the battered savings and loan industry, already losing $1 billion every month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This little question is the third rail of technology journalism. No other aspect of personal computing attracts so much emotion, or lands so much hate-mail in journalists' in boxes accusing them of bias. To make my own background clear: I've got a Mac on my desk at home and a PC on my desk at work. I swear at both. If it means anything, I've gotten a little more hate-mail from Apple advocates than PC partisans.But apart from those true believers, there are people who would just like to know which platform will be a better fit for their own purposes. There's no right answer, but here are a few things to ponder:Cost: At the entry level, there's no longer a big difference between the prices of Macs and PCs. The cheapest PC-and-monitor combo with 64 megabytes of memory (a realistic minimum) at Best Buy's site costs $580 after a rebate. The cheapest iMac system available costs $800. That $220 isn't pocket change, but it's not a huge gap, either.Apple stays roughly competitive with its rivals throughout the iMac line. But between $1,500 and $2,000, Apple has nothing to compete with Windows machines. If you're looking for a computer with some open expansion slots and a 17-inch monitor, a desktop PC will be awfully cheap compared to a Power Mac G4.Reliability: Both operating systems crash. A lot. Yes, it's possible to fine-tune either system to a remarkable degree of stability, but most users have neither the time nor the aptitude for that kind of tweaking. (I'm not addressing Microsoft's more reliable, more expensive and more resource-intensive Windows 2000, which is designed for business use.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In a grim assessment of the global economic outlook, the World Bank yesterday said that some of the world's least developed countries already have suffered a slump worse than the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s.Although U.S. government officials have shown optimism about the short-term global economic outlook, the present pattern of slow growth among developed nations and in developing countries raises concerns about the longer-term future, said the bank's annual World Development Report.The report by the bank's staff was sharply critical of Reagan administration policies, which it said contributed to the "economic turbulence and uncertainty" that have produced high interest rates, declining investment, rising protectionism and high unemployment in Europe.Stanley Fisher, chief economist for the bank, acknowledged that "the world economy appears to be in better shape" than when the report was completed a few months ago.Fisher acknowledged that the Reagan administration's strategy for dealing with the massive debts of many Third World nations, which avoids debt relief except for impoverished African countries, has left major Latin American debtors in no better shape than they were three years ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>or which rights. What baffles these senators is Bork۪s recognition of the problem that a judge has to choose among rights and his effort to find some principled basis for the choice. In all of their sentimental demagoguery about rights his opponents have never explained whose rights they want to subordinate. I have heard nothing from Bork to deny that the definition and allocation of rights properly change over time, by legislative action or judicial decisions, in response to changing conditions, including community values. But what I do hear from him is a reluctance to make a leap in the dark, declaring rights in particular cases without weighing the indirect and future consequences of such declarations.This brings up the question of precedents. There has been much discussion of whether Judge Bork properly respects the precedents created by previous court decisions. No attention has been paid to the question of a justice۪s respect for his successors, who may be bound by the precedents he sets. What I understand Bork to say is that a justice should not set precedents for his successors without carefully considering the full range of their implications.The Gnsuxdd case, in which we have all had' an education in the last two weeks, is an example. Here was a stupid Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives. The question is whether the best way to get rid of that stupid class. His iconodasm, while stimulating in a professor, can be disastrous in a judge. What is important is not how nimble his argument will be, but how his' decisions will affect millions of Americans who will have to live by them.So ultimately what we۪re asking is not only what۪s in Judge Bork۪s mind but also what۪s in his heart Is he sensitive to human and racial problems?I can hear his supporters saying that here comes the irrational argument. But it is prudence, not irrationality, to give as much emphasis to citizen Bork۪s past views as to nominee Bork۪s new views. His supporters say, "Can۪t one change his views?۝ Yes, certainly. Otherwise, how could we, in the last 32 years, have1 moved from a time when the air was heavy with racism to one in which the union of religious faith and civic action has begun to create a new American reality. So, yes, people can change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>QDEAR BOB: I have a FICO score of 750 and wonder why I am still paying private mortgage insurance. -- Jennifer R.When you bought your house or condo, you probably paid little or no cash down. Because of your high credit score, your lender approved a high loan-to-value ratio mortgage. The lender insisted on PMI to eliminate its foreclosure loss risk.Until you have at least 20 percent equity, your lender still views you as a high risk, which requires PMI to protect the lender.Also, until your home loan has at least 24 months of on-time monthly payments, most mortgage lenders will refuse to cancel PMI. Some especially nasty lenders will not cancel PMI until the loan balance declines below 80 percent of its original balance, ignoring your home improvements and market value appreciation.That usually takes 10 to 15 years, depending on your interest rate. If you have one of these really bad lenders, refinance with a different lender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amid happy bedlam on the three dozen bond trading floors scattered about the New York metropolitan area, a piercing wail of anguish rose last week from the respected Bridgewater Associates Inc.'s bond managers."This bond rally has been brutal," said the Wilton, Conn.-based investment advisory firm's daily report, as it agonizingly confessed it had recently lost heart and bet against the bond market rise. "For years, it seems, we've been waiting for a secular breakout of bond yields to 1960's levels. Here it is, and we're short. Obviously it's painful to have missed this move."The bond trading business - with the exception of the short-lived and perilous junk bond boom of the late 1980s - has traditionally been a back room gentlemen's game. It was the stock market that drew the headlines, the high rollers and the rapt attention of millions of small investors."The stock market is a lot easier for the layman to understand," said Larry Jones, president and chief executive of the GovPX Treasury market pricing service, which provides instant computer data on bond trading. "The bond market is different in that it is a fairly complex animal. It depends on macroeconomics," a measurement of the economy on a national scale, "which {small investors} may have taken in college, but they do not understand the real dynamics."Now they hunger to know more, and are joining institutional investors in tossing money into a bond market that has reached record levels in the past few weeks. With President Clinton's deficit reduction and tax policies indicating a slow-growth, low-inflation economy to many investors, with interest on overnight deposits at a minuscule 3 percent and with the stock market volatile and life uncertain, bonds have become hot items even as long-term Treasury interest rates have sunk to an all-time low of less than 7 percent.</TEXT>

The message that the Fed fears rising prices more than recession has been conveyed with the force of a slam dunk in basketball.In so doing, Greenspan has broken with President Bush, and has pulled along five of the six other Republican governors of the central bank.

The regulatory proposals are weak, but they are a good first step.One proposal would require that servicers credit payments on the days payments are received. Another would require servicers to provide accurate payoff statements within a reasonable time to borrowers who intend to pay off their loans. Both are fair, clear and not onerous for the lender.A third proposal would prohibit servicers from imposing late fees or delinquency charges when scheduled payments are received on time but do not include previous late charges. This rule would eliminate the practice of "pyramiding late fees," in which servicers continue to charge late fees until all previous late fees have been paid.But the proposal does not cover a worse type of pyramiding. When a scheduled payment is received on time but the escrow payment is short, the practice is to place the entire payment in a suspense account, charge the borrower a late fee and send a delinquency notice to the credit bureaus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like many real estate company executives, James J. Wilson, president and chief executive of Interstate General Co. L.P. in St. Charles, Md., worries about interest rates and federal policies that affect consumer demand for the homes his company builds and the lots it sells.Wilson fretted so much about the federal budget deficit last year that he voted for Ross Perot, he said, even though he didn't want the Texan to win. "You have to know what's going on at all levels [of government]. It's going to come back and affect you," Wilson said.He almost learned that lesson the hard way. Since going public in February 1987, the company Wilson founded in 1957 had posted a healthy string of profits until the fourth quarter of 1990, when it lost $473,000.The last two years were difficult. The worst came in the second quarter of 1992, when the company lost $16.2 million. Interstate General would have filed for bankruptcy, like many other developers, except for its racetrack and off-track-betting operation in Puerto Rico, and the revenue it made on the 8,000 apartment units it owns, Wilson said.Total revenue also declined, from a high of $64.4 million in 1990 to $41 million last year. Now, as quarterly profits are returning to the black ($2.3 million in the first quarter of the year), Wilson said he has decided to shift Interstate General's focus from home building and land development because they are so dependent on government actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The House and Senate Bank-iijg Committees yesterday voted to give President Ford the anti - inflation monitoring agency he requested Monday night.Members of both committees agreed that they were not giving the President any authority he did not already have, since hp could establish such a task force by executive order, But the consensus on botli committees was that it could not do any harm and since it was Mr. Ford۪s first request as President he should have it.Both Mouse and Senate arc] expected to vote Monday on their respective versions of the monitoring agency bill. Although the thrust of both proposals is the same, there are enough diferences to require a conference to shape a bill acceptable to both chambers.Both versions of the bill authorize Mr. Ford to set up a White House council to monitor wage and price developments and collect data on various sectors of the economy, in order to pinpoint both private and government sources of inflation.The proposed agency will, in effect, take the place of the larger and more powerful Cost of Living Council, which went out of existence .June 30. This agency would not have the power to impose mandatory wage and price controls, which the old Cost of Living Council had until April 30.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people look forward to daylight savings time. Others await baseball's opening pitch. Loop Fans, of course, look forward to the annual presentation of the "Congressional Pig Book," with its listing of the most egregious pork-barrel projects from this year's appropriations bills.The 12th annual rollout on Tuesday, complete with hogs of the four-legged variety and a list of the "Dirty Dozen" -- 12 states that have received the most pork per capita from 1995 to 2002 -- promises to be the best ever. That's because we're hailing record- breaking amounts of pork, 8,341 projects, and a record total of $20.1 billion in chops, ham, roasts and bacon, according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste.$14 million for the appropriately named Hollings Marine Laboratory in South Carolina -- as in Sen.

    <TEXT>White House anti-inflation czar Robert S. Strauss said yesterday President Carter should adopt the toughest possible" wage-price program he can, and not listen to those who contend it would hurt him politically.At a breakfast meeting with reporters. Strauss said the best politics۪* for Carter would be to propose a tough, tough, do-able program" that asks significant۝ sacrifices from all sectors of the economy.I think if he came up with a year of national denial, of national austerity. the public would buy it, business would buy it and labor would buy it," Strauss said. The president has to lay it on the line.۝Strauss۪ remarks essentially countered those of another White House official on Monday who cautioned that a stringent guidelines program might prove Carter۪s political undoing," and urged the plan be weakened.The developments came as Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, trying to assure organized labor, yesterday told a steel workers۪ union convention the administration۪s new wage-price program won۪t burden labor more than other groups.</TEXT>
