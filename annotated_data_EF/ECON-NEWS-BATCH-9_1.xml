    <TEXT>Would you pay $15,000 for a car? Most of us would consider the question odd: It depends on which car. In the current tax cut debate, 10-year revenue costs of $350 billion and $550 billion are being debated, but the question should be: for what? President Bush's tax cut was designed to provide short-term growth insurance and enhance long-term growth. Does it deliver?If you listen to the political rhetoric, the most controversial of the president's tax proposals is the elimination of the double tax on corporate income. This would not be the case if scientific analysis were introduced into the debate. So far, neither the administration nor the Joint Committee on Taxation has provided an element-by-element evaluation of the different proposals. Name-calling tends to break out when there is no substance to discuss.When the Council of Economic Advisers considered the economic benefits of the president's entire proposal, the agency emphasized demand-side effects on consumer spending and investment in the near term. Using a conventional forecasting model, effects of the tax plan on job prospects, household disposable income, and incentives to invest were projected to raise real GDP by about $670 billion over the next five years. This increase in output would raise revenues by $133 billion over that period.But even that analysis omits the long-run supply-side benefits. The dividend tax reduction has the strongest economic merits. Ending the double tax raises long-term income by increasing capital formation and improving the use of existing capital.The first thing to track is the direct effect on investment. The dividend tax cut significantly reduces the cost of financing new investments. If businesses invest more, economic growth increases. The connection between the cost of finance and business investment is one of the least contentious areas of economic science, and cautious applications of the results from studies of tax policy and investment suggest that eliminating dividend taxation should add about a quarter of a percentage point to real GDP every year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Italian auto maker Fiat SpA has an agreement to buy the U.S. Treasury's remaining 6% stake in Chrysler Group LLC, a move that would bring an end to the U.S. government's involvement in the Auburn Hills, Mich., auto maker.Fiat will pay the Treasury $500 million for its 98,461 shares of Chrysler and another $75 million for the right to purchase all of the 45.7% stake owned by the United Auto Workers union's health-care trust fund.The Treasury will retain 80% of the $75 million purchase right and share the remaining 20% with the Canadian government. In all, the Treasury will walk away with a total of $560 million in the deal, which is expected to close within the next 30 to 60 days following antitrust reviews.President Barack Obama is expected to announce the deal during a planned visit Friday to a Chrysler automobile assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio."As Treasury exits its investment in Chrysler, it's clear that President Obama's decision to stand behind and restructure this company was the right one," Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said in a statement Thursday. "Today, America's automakers are mounting one of the most improbable turnarounds in recent history--creating new jobs and making new investments in communities across our country."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- With the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates behind it, the options market looked forward to its next signpost: tomorrow's monthly expiration of options contracts.The problem is, traders and strategists frequently complain that expiration isn't as big an event in the options market as it once was. They say that this is partly because the position-rolling activity isn't as concentrated in the last few days leading up to expiration as it used to be.Cibc World Markets options strategist Michael Schwartz said that a midafternoon scan of yesterday's most-active options contracts yielded few suspects for trades that were rolling positions forward, those that occur when an options player moves a position's expiration farther out, sometimes also using the opportunity to move the strike price up or down.One possibility, though, was Cisco Systems Inc. With the stock falling 2 9/16 to finish at 58, Cisco's May 60 and June 70 calls were among the most active call contracts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that the activity may have been the result of expiration-related adjustments.Additionally, options trading hasn't been as active as some would like. Paul Foster, options strategist at 1010WallStreet.com, complained that this week's expiration is "the driest expiration I've seen" in the past 12 months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FED EFFORTS TO DAMP inflation have had little effect so far. Friday's report that producer prices jumped 1% in February, or at a 12.7% annual rate, alarmed economists and sent financial markets reeling. The surge in prices, which affected a broad range of items, makes it likely the Fed will push up interest rates even further, fueling recession fears.The Dow Jones industrials skidded 48.57, or 2%, to 2292.14, the worst drop in nearly a year. Bonds plunged, sending long-term Treasury yields to six-month highs. The dollar surged.---Adjustable-rate mortgages are reaching four year highs, while fixed-rate loans continue to near 2 1/2-year highs. The increases are starting to generate fear among some consumers and in the housing industry.---</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uncle Sam is about to start a national campaign to urge more Americans to use direct deposit for their benefit checks. Here's how to jump on board.The campaign, called Go Direct, is an effort by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to make it easier and safer for recipients of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income to get their monthly payments -- and in doing so, save the government millions of dollars in postage, printing and related costs.Currently, the Treasury Department mails about 160 million benefit checks a year, which translates into $100 million in printing and mailing expenses. In about 2 1/2 years, the first of 77 million baby boomers will become eligible for Social Security benefits, which could cause the number of mailings and related costs to soar.In March, federal officials completed a six-month pilot campaign, also called Go Direct, in three states and Puerto Rico to determine how best to motivate people to switch to electronic transfers of money to their bank accounts.The key: enlisting the help of local organizations and businesses -- including more than 13,000 volunteers at banks, senior centers and health and consumer groups -- to spread the word.</TEXT>
