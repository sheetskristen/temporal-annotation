    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's latest two nominees to the Federal Reserve Board said they expect the economic recovery to continue and see little risk of deflation, suggesting they think the Fed may have no need to cut interest rates again.Ben S. Bernanke and Donald Kohn, who would fill two remaining vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board of governors, told the Senate Banking Committee the economic outlook remains bright despite growing worries about the U.S. financial system."I think we're in a situation where vigilant optimism is probably the right approach," said Mr. Bernanke, a Princeton University economics professor who sits on a national committee that determines when recessions begin and end. "The economy is recovering, but there's no sign of inflation," he said.Asked if continuing weakness could lead to Fed rate cuts, he said that -- despite already-low rates -- "if necessary, we could do so."Mr. Bernanke, 48 years old, also said the recent decline of U.S. stock prices has done "large and serious harm" to national wealth that could hurt economic growth for the rest of the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The dollar looks poised to weaken somewhat this week, as the market turns its attention to the last big batch of data ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of the month.However, political events elsewhere could help the dollar, as Japan readies for its June 25 Lower House election and Europe grapples with economic reform. Analysts expect the dollar to trade in a range of 103 yen and 108 yen and near 96 cents against the euro.Many European markets are closed today for a holiday.Analysts expect more data indicating that the U.S. economy is slowing, which would feed speculation that the Fed will pass on raising interest rates at its June 27-28 meeting. "The key data are retail sales and consumer prices," said John Rothfield, senior currency strategist at Bank of America in San Francisco. "We expect those to be benign, and that will probably trigger a rally in some of the other currencies."The producer-price index for May, announced Friday, was unchanged, suggesting that consumer prices also will be benign and leaving an uncertain outlook for U.S. interest rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Automobile makers raised prices and reduced dealer incentives on 2004 car models in October while California, the nation's biggest auto market, increased car taxes -- moves that prompted consumers to cut back on purchases.That was the upshot of a slew of government data released Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that producer prices rose a larger-than-expected 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October from the month before, largely because of higher auto prices. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau reported retail sales slipped 0.3% in October, largely due to declining auto sales."Manufacturers are adjusting incentives in part to see how well their products can do without incentives as the economy strengthens," said Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J.D. Power & Associates, a market research company. "Consumers, being finicky as they are, just don't like to see incentives go down, and they're pulling back."The Federal Reserve also reported that industrial production rose for the fourth straight month in October, but the pace of increases was curtailed by a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies.Some auto makers responded by fattening incentives in November. This is leading some economists to predict the October sales slowdown and the spike in prices will be temporary. "It is the pregnant pause of a wiser consumer," said David Littman, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Detroit. Underscoring expectations of a pickup in consumer spending later in the year, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose to 93.5 in early November, stronger than the late October reading of 89.6.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LONDON -- Norway offered the first major yen issue since January to strong demand Thursday, and a 300 million Canadian dollar ($241.4 million) issue for BCE Inc. marked the largest launch in that sector.No new bonds were launched in U.S. dollars, and seasoned Eurodollar issues closed mostly unchanged as the U.S. Treasury market continued to drift on dollar weakness and inflation concerns.Norway's 50 billion yen ($394.3 million), seven-year issue, priced to yield 5.12% by lead manager Daiwa Europe Ltd., was well-received.Syndicate specialists said the bonds were correctly priced, and co-managers said they had plenty of clients in Europe interested in the issue because of the borrower and the lack of supply in this sector.But they were critical of the way the issue was handled by the lead manager, charging that Daiwa had widely pre-placed the paper in Europe Wednesday and then overnight in Tokyo. They noted that a preplacement period is usually a few hours before the official launch, not a full day.</TEXT>
