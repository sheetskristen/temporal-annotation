    <TEXT>What's the best way to make sure that a market crash like Oct. 19 doesn't happen again?After a little more than two months of deliberations, the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, also known as the Brady commission, has rolled out its proposals. They range from giving the Federal Reserve a bigger regulatory role to introducing "circuit breakers" that can cool the pace of trading before a panic sets in.Some market professionals are already arguing that the recommendations go too far; others, that they don't go far enough.Here's a review of the five major recommendations by the presidential task force, in question-and-answer form.Q: What is the central goal of the task force's recommendations?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U.S. stocks got another shot in the arm on Friday, closing out the week with a surge that put the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for the best September in 71 years.The Dow leapt 197.84 points, or 1.9%, to 10860.26. The Dow rose 2.4% this week, extending its weekly win streak to four. The benchmark is up 8.4% this month, the best September since a 13.5% rise in 1939. Investors snapped up commodities and the euro, all signs of an increasing tolerance for riskier assets.Gold set another record and briefly pierced $1,300 an ounce.The day's advances began in Europe, after a strong German business sentiment survey helped reassure investors that the export giant's economic machine was humming. U.S. economic data a few hours later showed companies spending more, helping paint a picture of increasing corporate aggressiveness at a time when the global economy looks to be on the rise."That's what this market needed: solid signals that companies are spending their money, at a time when global demand is intact," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. With the dollar weakening against most other currencies, she said, "that's supportive of export-driven companies."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has been nearly a year since Thailand devalued the baht, setting off worldwide market drops -- and what a ride it has been.Most Asian portfolio managers would probably prefer to put the past 12 months well behind them, if they haven't quit their jobs already and decided to sail around the world instead. And pity the small investor, avidly checking up on the performance of his Asian mutual funds over breakfast only to find that day after day, Asian markets suffered staggering declines.Since July 2, 1997 when Thailand let the baht float, Asian currencies and stock markets have crumbled, jolting emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. Even the European and U.S. stock markets have felt the heat from Asia's plunge, though both markets have been resilient.So what's an investor to do now? Steer clear of Asia, lighten up on U.S. holdings, and load up on European stocks, say the experts."Big and liquid is beautiful," says Leila Heckman, managing director of global asset allocation at Salomon Smith Barney in New York.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks don't do nearly as well when the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, so what are small-cap portfolio managers doing to prepare? Not a heck of a lot.The annual gain of the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks falls to roughly 3.5% when the Fed is raising rates, compared with its historical average advance of 12%, according to James Furey, chief small-cap analyst at Lehman Brothers.The reasons for the falloff include smaller stocks being closely tied to the performance of the U.S. economy, which can be slowed by interest-rate increases. Also, smaller businesses face the prospect of having to pay more for loans, which could curb their expansion.When the Fed has raised rates in the past, defensive areas like energy and certain health-care stocks fared better, while economically sensitive shares, such as retailers, home builders and manufacturers lagged behind. But don't assume that portfolio managers are positioning themselves to follow the past performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Homer's Furniture Co. survived two World Wars, the Great Depression and close calls from cutthroat competitors and building slumps. But Homer's couldn't survive the current crunch, which has wiped out hundreds of furniture stores across the country.Based in Chicago, Homer's was known for custom-crafted furnishings, once using extra-high cushions to make a sofa more accessible for a paraplegic couple. But by making its own furniture, the family-owned chain had high fixed costs. Then the recession cut customer traffic. Discount wars ate up margins. Specialty stores siphoned sales. In 1991, Homer's lost money for the second consecutive year, and the company's creditor shut Homer's five stores on New Year's Eve."When it happens, it's like a loved one lying in bed dying, and one day he closes his eyes," says Chairman Marvin Homer, whose immigrant father founded the company in 1912 with four brothers. "I felt numb."The home-furnishing business has taken a beating this recession as consumers have decided they can do without new $1,200 wicker sofas and $700 paisley poufs. Retail sales of furniture fell 6% last year, to $28.19 billion, the second consecutive yearly decline in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to Wallace Epperson, an analyst at Mann Armistead & Epperson, based in Richmond, Va. More than 1,800 furniture-store companies went out of business in the first 10 months of last year, up 21% from the year-ago period, reports Dun & Bradstreet Corp.Not just the mom and pop operations are failing. This month, Seaman Furniture Co., operating under heavy debt after going private four years ago, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors. The furniture retailer, based in Uniondale, N.Y., said it plans to close 15 of its 37 stores. The wreckage is even worse in Southern California, land of high rents and upscale upholstery, where Barker Bros., RB Furniture Inc. and at least two other major retail furniture chains have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months.</TEXT>
