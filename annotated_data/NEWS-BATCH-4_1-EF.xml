    <TEXT>With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever: Have the financial markets detached themselves from the "real" economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product?For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes. And they find it misguided to see the gyrations of the 1998 U.S. stock market as a reliable indicator of either a continued boom or an imminent bust.The stock decline is "not telling us a thing about the U.S. economy," said James F. Smith Jr., professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. "There's hardly anything wrong with the U.S. economy today that you can't solve with lower interest rates."It's tempting to believe otherwise, of course. It was less than eight weeks ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record 9337.97. Optimists saw it as proof of a new economic paradigm. Bolder types concluded, as they had in past years, that the business cycle had been repealed by tremendous strides in technology and productivity, justifying enormous leaps in stock prices.Today, just a few weeks later, doomsayers point to the plunging financial markets and the global damage inflicted by the Asian crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Small stocks fell as mounting economic worries pulled the plug on a videogame celebration.The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 7.8 points, or 1.02%, to 759.97; the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 shed 3.62, or 0.91%, to 395.15.Shares of videogame makers powered up after large-cap Activision and Vivendi's game unit agreed to a combination. Take-Two Interactive Software rose $1.30, or 8.7%, to $16.28."I don't know if we're going to tumble into a recession under the classic definition, but we're certainly in pullback, or slowdown mode," said Georges Yared, chief investment strategist at Yared Investment Research, after some soft manufacturing data. "When you look at spending, whether it be automotive or large-ticket items, consumers have pulled back."Jakks Pacific rose 1.33, or 5.3%, to 26.57 after winning a crucial round in its legal tangle with World Wrestling Entertainment. A federal court dismissed the Stamford, Conn., wrestling promoter's suit related to how Jakks originally obtained a WWE toy license. World Wrestling Entertainment fell 12 cents to 15.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So-called managed-payout funds, introduced with much fanfare just two years ago, were supposed to be a boon for retirees. Some of the hype might have been premature, however.It has long been one of the biggest questions and challenges for people entering retirement: How do I generate a steady paycheck from my savings? Managed-payout mutual funds offer an answer.Designed by some of the biggest names in the financial-services business -- Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab, among others -- these investments use different strategies but start with the same concept: Place a pool of money in a range of investments, much like an endowment at a university. Ideally, the funds generate a predictable, but not guaranteed, stream of income in a format that gives investors easy access to their money.That kind of predictability already was available from insurer-run annuities. But many retirees are loathe to turn over their money to annuities, from which it can be difficult to withdraw funds. What's more, insurers generally keep any remaining money when you die.Bear-Market Debut</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy. That means more volatility lies ahead. Investors should watch out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ASIA/PACIFICSouth Korea to Seek Free-Trade Pact With U.S.WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration will begin negotiations with South Korea -- the U.S.'s seventh-largest export market -- in a bid to lift trade barriers between them, trade officials from both nations announced."This is the most commercially significant free-trade negotiation we have embarked on in 15 years," U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman said. "Removing trade and investment barriers between our two nations through a [free-trade agreement] will increase market access for our farmers, ranchers, workers and businesses to the dynamic and growing Korean economy."With annual gross domestic product approaching $1 trillion, South Korea is the world's 10th-largest economy.</TEXT>
