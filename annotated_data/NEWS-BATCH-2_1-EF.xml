    <TEXT>GREENSPAN SUGGESTED that progress against inflation may be drawing to a close, but stopped short of saying policy makers will have to raise interest rates. The Fed chairman said 1996 so far "has been a good year" for the economy, but that it would begin to slow down in the second half. He said the Fed will be in a state of "heightened surveillance" for signs of higher inflation in weeks ahead.Stocks and bonds rallied on his testimony. The benchmark bond's price rose nearly 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield back below 7%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 87.30 to 5464.18, and the Nasdaq gained 23.17 to 1109.82.---AT&T showed significantly lower calling volume and revenue growth in the second quarter, though its overall net income rose by 10%. The company's shares fell 4% to $54.125.Lucent posted strong quarterly revenue growth, but profit was cut by the high cost of splitting from AT&T.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Technology shares dived yesterday after Intel Corp.'s stock was downgraded by two analysts who cited its recent sharp appreciation in price.The downgrades were all investors needed to sell Intel, which many saw as a soaring stock that had gotten ahead of itself. Intel swooned 4.6%, tumbling $7.50 to $157.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.With technology stocks trading on momentum as waves of new investors recently poured in, all it took was a couple of blips of negative news to trigger broadbased profit-taking, analysts said."Today was mindless," said Roger McNamee, partner at technology investment firm Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. "Tech-stock investors fluctuate from euphoria to blind panic, and right now we're in the blind panic mode." In his opinion, "these stocks are a lot better buy today than they were yesterday."The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 25.31 points, or 1.84%, to 1348.44.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- Japanese stocks pulled back yesterday, as uncertainty over the downfall of corporate financier Yoshiaki Murakami and declines in U.S. stocks from Friday prompted profit-taking in pricey blue-chip shares such as Toyota Motor, Canon and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial.But many of the stocks in Mr. Murakami's fund rose, after falling sharply on Friday on fears the fund might sell off its shares.The Nikkei Stock Average dropped 121 points, or 0.8%, to 15668.31 following a 285.57-point rally on Friday.Most investors said the effect likely would be limited on the overall Tokyo stock market from the Murakami scandal. But some also said they want to see foreign investors' reactions to the news. Mr. Murakami, who leads the so-called Murakami Fund, admitted yesterday that he had violated the country's insider-trading laws, and would step away from his own fund and investments.Yesterday, the home for many of the Murakami stocks of start-up companies, the TSE Mothers market, saw its index rise 3.4% to 1393.86, but it is still down about 50% from its year high of 2799.06 in January. Among the stocks in which the Murakami fund holds a major stake, Matsuzakaya, Sumitomo Warehouse, GMO Internet and New Japan Radio all rose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DETROIT -- Even as the auto industry and environmental groups gird for another political fight over fuel economy, private discussions are under way to work out a truce.The Big Three auto makers, the United Auto Workers union and environmental activists are negotiating to try to come up with a joint proposal for what they have come to conclude is the most realistic way to improve the fuel economy of the U.S. automotive fleet: a big package of federal subsidies designed to seed a consumer market for vehicles that go farther on a gallon of gas.Though the longtime antagonists are far from a deal, the fact that they are negotiating at all marks a big shift, suggesting each of them has decided the political impasse in Washington over fuel economy is contrary to its interests. For the auto industry, an intensifying political battle over the fuel consumption of sport-utility vehicles has become a public-relations nightmare. For the union, the specter of a shift toward newer, more-efficient vehicles raises worries about job losses for its members.For environmentalists, the realization is setting in that a severe toughening of the federal government's fuel-economy rule is a political nonstarter. Therefore, some of them are concluding, the only way to get substantial improvement in the fuel economy of the U.S. fleet is to spur market demand for more-efficient vehicles. That is a tough task in a country where gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, remain at historically low levels. But it is precisely the tactic the auto industry has been endorsing all along."Many of us want to solve the problem and get to a solution," said Ashok Gupta, director of the air and energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups involved in the discussions. "So you have to think out of the box and try to break the gridlock."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Asian markets were mostly lower early Monday as a surge in oil prices amid continued worries over the turmoil in the Middle East, and news China is targeting lower growth over the next five years, dampened sentiment.Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was off 0.6%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi Composite was off 1.3%. New Zealand's NZX-50 was up 0.3%.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.5%. The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.4% and the Shenzhen Composite Index was 0.5% lower.Comments on Sunday from China's premier Wen Jiabao that the government wants slower economic growth to avoid inflation and to restructure the economy hurt the growth-sensitive Australian dollar and depressed the Tokyo stock market."The comments suggest further, multipronged monetary tightening, more curbs on the real estate market, and a stronger yuan," Credit Agricole said in a note to clients.</TEXT>
